# UBER Tip Frequency Problem

**Analysis of weekly trips statistics of a random driver in Phoenix, AZ**

*Author: Valeriy Kondruk*

## Research question: On which day of the week riders tip most frequently?

That would be great to know if there’s any correlation between the day of the week and tip amount and tipping frequency for a particular driver.

We have a data set covering 55 consequtive weeks of driving history. Using this sample, we want to make an inference about the population (all possible weeks for this particular driver).

# UBER Fare Level problem

In National Tipping Field Experiment, Chandar, et al. (2019) report that “riders are more likely to tip as the fare of the trip increses, but at a decreasing rate.”

## Research question: Does our data align with this statement? Is there an association between the fare level and tip size?

# Machine Learning modeling with H2O.ai engine

It's pretty clear that we cannot make predictions on the tipping size and/or frequency based on the data Uber provides to its drivers. That would be interesting to check if pick-up/drop-off location impacts tipping but we don't have these data now. Also, we can try including time of the day in the model. There is a widespread belief that people tip more during the late night trips. We doubt this, but it would be interesting to find out.
