# UBER Tip Frequency Problem

**Analysis of weekly trips statistics of a random driver in Phoenix, AZ**

*Author: Valeriy Kondruk*

## Research question: On which day of the week riders tip most frequently?

That would be great to know if there’s any correlation between the day of the week and tip amount and tipping frequency for a particular driver.

We have a data set covering 55 consequtive weeks of driving history. Using this sample, we want to make an inference about the population (all possible weeks for this particular driver).

# UBER Fare Level problem

In National Tipping Field Experiment, Chandar, et al. (2019) report that “riders are more likely to tip as the fare of the trip increses, but at a decreasing rate.”

## Research question: Does our data align with this statement? Is there an association between the fare level and tip size?
