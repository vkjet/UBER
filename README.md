# UBER Tip Frequency Problem

Analysis of weekly trips statistics of a random driver in Phoenix, AZ

## Research question: 
## On which day of the week riders tip most frequently?

That would be great to know if thereâ€™s any correlation between the day of the week and tip amount and tipping frequency for a particular driver.

We have a data set covering 55 consequtive weeks of driving history. Using this sample, we want to make an inference about the population (all possible weeks for this particular driver).
